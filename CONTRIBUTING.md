# Contributing to the project

This outlines how to propose a change to the project. 

### Fixing typos

Minor typos or grammatical errors in the documentation could be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

*  YES: you edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.
*  NO: you edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.

### Prerequisites

Before making a substantial pull request, you should file an issue and
make sure at least one team member agrees. If you've found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

*  We recommend creating a Git branch for each pull request.  
*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org) or PEP8 [style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
