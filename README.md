  - authors: Joshua Sia, Morgan Rosenberg, Sufang Tan, Yinan Guo

Data analysis project for DSCI 522 (Data Science Workflows); a
course in the Master of Data Science program at the University of
British Columbia.

## About

The data set used in this project contains county-level data on health, 
socioeconomics, weather, and COVID-19 cases compiled by John Davis. It
can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/johnjdavisiv/us-counties-covid19-weather-sociohealth-data),
specifically, the `US_counties_COVID19_health_weather_data.csv` file.
Each row in the data set represents a date corresponding to the number of
COVID-19 cases in the county, as well as other features about the county
(e.g. smokers percentage, population, income ratio, etc.).
